This is the final term project of COMP 1630 (Relational Database Design & SQL) I took at BCIT.  I wrote SQL scripts for this project to performs various functions on the dataset, such as querying and manipulating data.

The SQL dataset is a fictional database related to an e-commerce system. It contains several tables, including Customers, Employees, Shippers, Suppliers, Products, Orders, and OrderDetails. Each table stores specific information about customers, employees, suppliers, products, orders, and order details. Please see page 2 of the PDF "Comp 1630 Project" for the entity relationship diagram of these tables.

Here are the key SQL statements/clauses used in the queries:

1) SELECT: Retrieves specific columns from multiple tables.
2) FROM: Specifies the tables from which to retrieve data.
3) JOIN: Combines rows from multiple tables based on matching columns.
4) WHERE: Filters the rows based on a specified condition.
5) ORDER BY: Sorts the result set based on a specified column.
6) CREATE VIEW: Creates a virtual table (view) that combines specific columns from table(s), providing a customized view of the data as if it were a regular table.
7) UPDATE: Modifies existing data in a table, allowing users to change the values of specific columns based on specified conditions.
8) INSERT INTO: Inserts a new row into a table, allowing users to add new data with specified values.
9) CREATE PROCEDURE: Creates a named collection of SQL statements that can be executed multiple times, allowing you to execute them repeatedly with a single command 
10) CREATE TRIGGER: Define a specific action or set of actions that should be automatically executed when a specified event occurs in the database.

I achieved 97% (A+) as a final grade for this course.
